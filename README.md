# Learning Docker

Learning Docker is a guided tour through the basic concepts of Docker, through to specific goals with clear value. You'll quickly and steadily come out equipped and able to improve your day-to-day development in similar contexts.

**Disclaimer:** This guide explicitly avoids the temptation to become a Docker usage reference. Instead, we work at a higher level with use case problems that a developer encounters and work through those. As you may have realised that in this case we favour [goal-driven learning](http://datavibe.com/blog/pros-cons-of-smart-goals) as opposed to the encyclopediac approach.
